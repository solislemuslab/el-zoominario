**What is El Zoominario?**
It is a seminar series of scientific short talks (in English) given by Latinx in STEM. The goal is to increase visibility of Latinx people in STEM and inspire the next generation of Latinx scientists. The talks are meant to be accessible to the general audience.

**What is the format of the talks?**
The talks are 15-20 minutes long of a scientific topic explained in accessible terms to a broad audience. At the end of the talk, the speaker chooses to share interesting facts about their Latinx culture.

**How can I watch?**
Currently, live attendance is restricted to people at UW-Madison and close collaborators. Anybody can watch the recorded talks in the [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1AfUDnwvYbOA9rfrvyA2nR9SR0VYbklx).

**I am at UW-Madison, how can I watch the talks live?**
You need to join the UW google group "el-zoominario" (or email me) to be added to the mailing list. Emails to the group will contain login information.

**Why are the youtube comments disabled?**
Currently, we do not have the time to guarantee that all comments will be polite, respectful and family-friendly. Since we want to make these talks accessible to any audience, we prefer to block comments for now.

**I want to give a talk or nominate someone to give a talk?**
